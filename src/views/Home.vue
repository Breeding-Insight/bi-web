        <p>By combining genomics with the powerful tools of informatics, breeding for genetic gain has undergone a revolution. But due to high-costs, some smaller breeding programs have been left behind. The mission of the Breeding Insight team is to make high-tech breeding a reality for smaller programs.</p>
        <p>Breeding Insight is funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Agricultural Research Service (ARS) through Cornell University. The USDA ARS delivers scientific solutions to national and global agricultural challenges. As a global leader in agricultural discovery through scientific excellence, ARS is committed to delivering cutting-edge, scientific tools and innovative solutions for American farmers, producers, industry, and communities to support the nourishment and well-being of all people; sustaining our nationâ€™s agroecosystems and natural resources; and ensuring the economic competitiveness and excellence of our agriculture.</p>
